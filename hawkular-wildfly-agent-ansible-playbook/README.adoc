This set of Ansible playbooks/roles allows you to install WildFly application servers with embedded Hawkular WildFly Agents that monitor those WildFly instances.

* To configure the Ansible playbooks/roles:

1. *hosts*: Lists all the hosts where you want to put your WildFly application servers or where your existing WildFly application servers are.
2. *group_vars/wildfly-servers/main.yml*: Configures the file system locations of the WildFly application servers, credentials to use to obtain and run the Hawkular WildFly agent, and other things.

* To install WildFly application servers that are monitored by Hawkular WildFly Agents:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts install-wildfly-with-hawkular-wildfly-agent.yml
```

Once installed, you can start and stop the WildFly application servers, and get their statuses.

NOTE: If you are running multiple WildFly application servers on the same machine, you must specify their bind addresses or port offsets by setting either the _wildfly_bind_address_ variable or increase the _wildfly_port_offset_ variable. Both are defined in the _group_vars/wildfly-servers/main.yml_ file or you may optionally pass one or both to the ansible-playbook via the command line option _--extra-vars "name1=value1 name2=value2"_)

* To start the WildFly application servers:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts start-wildfly.yml
```

* To stop the WildFly application servers:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts stop-wildfly.yml
```

* To see the statuses of the WildFly application servers:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts status-wildfly.yml
```
