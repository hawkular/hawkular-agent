== SUMMARY

This command CLI utility allows you to send commands to the Hawkular Server over the command gateway websocket,
which in turn can forward the command to the agent.

It can be run on the command line like this:

```
java -jar hawkular-wildfly-agent-command-cli-*.jar <options>
```

where options include things such as your credentials, the command you want to send along with its parameters,
as well as optional binary data.

An example command to deploy a WAR to a specific WildFly instance in inventory:

```
java -jar hawkular-wildfly-agent-command-cli-*.jar \
   --server-url http://myhost:8080 \
   --username myuser \
   --password myPassword \
   --command DeployApplicationRequest \
   '-PresourcePath=/t;hawkular/f;c15f9426-734e-4ee6-82d3-7b0d82c41a6d/r;Local~~'
   -PdestinationFileName=hello-world.war
   --binary-data-file=/home/me/files/hello-world.war
```

Refer to the command gateway JSON schemas to know what commands can be passed (the command name is the name of the schema)
and what parameters those commands support.
